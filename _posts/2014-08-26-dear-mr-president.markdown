<p style="text-align: center;">Dear Mr. President,<br>
Come take a walk with me.<br>
Let’s pretend we’re just two people and<br>
You’re not better than me.<br>
I’d like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?<br>
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?<br>
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?<br>
Are you proud?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?<br>
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?<br>
How do you walk with your head held high?<br>
Can you even look me in the eye<br>
And tell me why?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dear Mr. President,<br>
Were you a lonely boy?<br>
Are you a lonely boy?<br>
Are you a lonely boy?<br>
How can you say</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No child is left behind?<br>
We’re not dumb and we’re not blind.<br>
They’re all sitting in your cells<br>
While you pave the road to hell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What kind of father would take his own daughter’s rights away?<br>
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?<br>
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say<br>
You’ve come a long way from whiskey and cocaine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?<br>
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?<br>
How do you walk with your head held high?<br>
Can you even look me in the eye?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Let me tell you ’bout hard work<br>
Minimum wage with a baby on the way<br>
Let me tell you ’bout hard work<br>
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Let me tell you ’bout hard work<br>
Building a bed out of a cardboard box<br>
Let me tell you ’bout hard work<br>
Hard work<br>
Hard work<br>
You don’t know nothing ’bout hard work<br>
Hard work<br>
Hard work<br>
Oh</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">How do you sleep at night?<br>
How do you walk with your head held high?<br>
Dear Mr. President,<br>
You’d never take a walk with me.<br>
Would you?</p>
