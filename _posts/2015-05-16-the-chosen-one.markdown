<p><center>In a time of darkness and greed<br />
It is your light that we need<br />
You came to teach us how to live<br />
Muhammad Ya Rasool Allah<br />
You were so caring and kind<br />
Your soul was full of light<br />
You are the best of mankind<br />
Muhammad Khaira Khalqillah<br />
Sallu ‘ala Rasulillah, Habib Al Mustafa<br />
Peace be upon The Messenger<br />
The Chosen One<span id="more-1698"></span></p>
<p>From luxury you turned away<br />
And all night you would pray<br />
Truthful in every word you say<br />
Muhammad Ya Rasul Allah</p>
<p>Your face was brighter than the sun<br />
Your beauty equaled by none<br />
You are Allah’s Chosen One<br />
Muhammad Khaira Khalqillah<br />
Sallu ‘ala Rasulillah, Habib Al Mustafa<br />
Peace be upon The Messenger<br />
The Chosen One</p>
<p>I will try to follow your way<br />
And do my best to live my life<br />
As you taught me<br />
I pray to be close to you<br />
On that day and see you smile<br />
When you see me<br />
Sallu ‘ala Rasulillah, Habibil Mustafa<br />
Peace be upon The Messenger<br />
The Chosen One</p>
<p>Sallu ‘ala Rasulillah, Habibi Mustafa<br />
Peace be upon The Messenger<br />
The Chosen One</p>
